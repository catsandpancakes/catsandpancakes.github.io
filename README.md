# RicePancakes - HackTheBox/VulnHub Write-Ups

## Introduction

Hello! You have found the Git repository for https://catsandpancakes.github.io. 

This is meant to be a site for any HackTheBox/VulnHub boxes I manage to complete. That's about it, really. 

## Some Details

This site is running on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), with a customised [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. 

I'm still a newbie at CSS/HTML and web design in general, so any tips are welcome. 

I do my write-ups with [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), which are exported in markdown format, then imported into Jekyll. This used to be hosted on WordPress.com, but due to workflow  issues and some formatting issues, I decided to migrate this site to GitHub Pages before it got too big to migrate. 

My preferred code editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and occassionally [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).
