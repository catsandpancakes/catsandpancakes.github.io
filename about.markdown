I am just someone who is interested in tech and taking things apart. I currently work as a system administrator. I also like cats. 

This blog is mainly for HackTheBox/VulnHub write-ups, but I will only be doing write-ups for boxes which are at my current skill level. I'm still learning, but I'm also trying to push the boundaries at the same time. That being said, don't expect to see every box here. 

If you need to contact me, you may either [email me](mailto:ricepancakes@protonmail.com), or drop me a message at the [HackTheBox forums](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/profile/ricepancakes). I will try to get back to you as soon as I can. 

Cheers.
