Here's a list of some of my favourite tools I use when doing CTFs that aren't included in Kali Linux. This is listed in no particular order. 

If you have any suggestions, or if you feel that a better tool is out there, do hit me up via [email](mailto:ricepancakes@protonmail.com) or drop me a message on the [HackTheBox forums](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/profile/ricepancakes).

- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) - A very useful collection of wordlists for fuzzing or dictionary attacks, by danielmiessler on Github. 
- [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) - TCP tunnel over SSH, handy for bypassing firewall restrictions via port forwarding/reverse port forwarding, by jpillora on Github. 
- [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) - Web application fuzzer, by joohoi on Github. I think the syntax makes more sense than `wfuzz`. 
- [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)/[winPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/winPEAS) - Automatic enumeration scripts for *nix and Windows systems, by carlospolop on Github. 
- [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) - A collection of offensive PowerShell scripts which are handy for attacking Windows boxes, by samratashok on Github.
- [Pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz) - Basically, Mimikatz written in Python, by skelsec on Github. Pypykatz allows you to dump hashes on your local machine, which I feel is a big plus over Mimikatz. 
- [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) - Serialise everything, by frohoff on Github.
